# Credit-EDA-Risk-Analytics
Description / Summary:
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan application data to understand risk patterns in lending. It aims to help financial institutions identify clients likely to default, enabling informed decisions on loan approvals while minimizing losses.

Objectives:
Analyze client and loan attributes to identify patterns indicating repayment difficulties.
Explore missing data, outliers, and data imbalance.
Identify top factors influencing default risk using univariate, bivariate, and correlation analysis.
Dataset:
application_data.csv: Client information at the time of application
previous_application.csv: Clientâ€™s previous loan data
columns_description.csv: Data dictionary
Tech Stack: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Key Insights:
Identified top variables contributing to default risk.
Visualizations helped understand patterns in client repayment behavior.
Insights can help adjust loan policies, interest rates, and risk strategies.
